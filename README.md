## Personal projects related to deep learning with images

### Contents

#### Cats vs Dogs:
Building a basic 3-layer cnn model as well as transfer learning model to predict a dataset of cats and dogs. The resultant transfered ResNet50 was used to predict several of my own personal photos. This serves as a basic cnn model building for me to understand cnn models.

#### Signature forgery verification through a siamese cnn model:
Built on top of my understand of cnn models, the siamese cnn model uses 2 identical cnn models which were trained in parallel and predicts whether a pair of images is 'identical' or not. Again, the simple model was able to achieve high validation accuracy of about 95% from a signature dataset from Kaggle.
