## Cats vs Dogs

### Overview 

This short project formalizes my understanding of image recognition / classification using a cnn model. The dataset was from a [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition) of cats and dogs of 25,000 images. A simple cnn model with 3 layers was used initially to train on the images and subsequently data augmentation and dropouts were used to help this model from overfitting. Transfer learning of the ResNet50 model was done to see if the accuracy improves. 

Lastly, the model was used to predict some of my own personal photos. 

The train folder is used to store the images while the img_predict folder is used to store images used by the model for predictions towards the end of the jupyter notebook.
